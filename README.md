# Materials and Information for a simple DIY Synth workshop.

## What it is: 
- A breadboard square wave oscillator that is controlled by a Light Dependent Resistor, and a tiny speaker.

## How to order parts:
1. Determine how many kits you want. About 25 ~ 30 has worked well in the past.

2. Buy the Mouser Parts:
    1. Follow this [link](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?State=EDIT&ProjectGUID=3b75a461-58cb-41e8-8639-0240dbf1eebd "Mouser parts for a single kit") to the  Mouser project page for a single kit.
    2. On the Mouser page, next to the green "Order Project" button, enter the number of kits desired.
    3. Note that you may want to order an extra kit or two, in case someone breaks or looses something.
    4. Click the "Order Project" button to place the parts in a Mouser cart.
    5. Follow this [link](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/517-923351-I "Jumper wire kit at Mouser") to the Jumper Wire Kit on Mouser.
    6. Each Jumper Wire Kit has enough wire for about 30 kits.
    7. Add the required number of Jumper Wire Kits to the existing Mouser cart with the green "Buy" button.
    8. Complete the Mouser order.

3. Buy the Light Dependent Resistors:
    1. Follow this [link](http://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/photocells-cds-5mm-diameter/ "Light Dependent Resistors at Small Bear") to the Light Dependent Resistor page on the Small Bear Electronics website.
    2. Choose option "9200". (If this option is out of stock, substitute another option).
    3. Buy the desired number of Light Dependent Resistors, one LRD per kit.
    4. Complete the purchase for the Light Dependent Resistors on the Small Bear site.

## Parts Preparation:
- Once the parts arrive, someone will need to unpack them and get them ready.
- The speakers need stiff wires soldered to them. You can use some of the Jumper Wires from the kit, or some solid core 22awg wire, or clipped off resistor legs, etc.
- Some of the Jumper Wires will need to be trimmed and bent to suit the layout.
- The parts should be counted and sorted into individual kits ahead of time.
- Do a test build to verify that everything works as expected.
